            SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says it successfully test
            fired what it described as newly developed long-range cruise
            missiles over the weekend, its first known testing activity in
            months, underscoring how it continues to expand its military
            capabilities amid a stalemate in nuclear negotiations with the
            United States. The Korean Central News Agency said Monday the cruise
            missiles, which had been under development for two years,
            successfully hit targets 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) away during
            flight tests on Saturday and Sunday.

            The North hailed its new missiles as a “strategic weapon of great
            significance” that meets leader Kim Jong Un’s call to strengthen the
            country’s military might, implying that they were being developed
            with an intent to arm them with nuclear warheads. South Korea's
            Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military was analyzing the North
            Korean launches based on U.S. and South Korean intelligence. Kim
            during a congress of the ruling Workers’ Party in January doubled
            down on his pledge to bolster his nuclear deterrent in the face of
            U.S. sanctions and pressure and issued a long wish list of new
            sophisticated assets, including longer-range intercontinental
            ballistic missiles, nuclear-powered submarines, spy satellites and
            tactical nuclear weapons. Kim also said then that his national
            defense scientists were developing “intermediate-range cruise
            missiles with the most powerful warheads in the world.” North
            Korea’s weapons tests are meant to build a nuclear and missile
            program that can stand up to what it claims as U.S. and South Korean
            hostility, but they are also considered by outside analysts as ways
            to make its political demands clear to leaders in Washington and
            Seoul. The North’s resumption of testing activity is likely an
            attempt at pressuring the Biden administration over the diplomatic
            freeze after Kim failed to leverage his arsenal for economic
            benefits during the the presidency of Donald Trump. North Korea
            ended a yearlong pause in ballistic tests in March by firing two
            short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, continuing a tradition
            of testing new U.S. administrations with weapons demonstrations
            aimed at measuring Washington’s response and wresting concessions.
            But there hadn’t been any known test launches for months after that
            as Kim focused national efforts on fending off the coronavirus and
            salvaging his economy. KCNA said the missiles tested over the
            weekend traveled for 126 minutes “along an oval and pattern-8 flight
            orbits” above North Korean land and waters before hitting their
            targets. “The test launches showed that the technical indices such
            as the thrust power of the newly developed turbine-blast engine, the
            missiles’ navigation control and the end guided hit accuracy by the
            combined guided mode met the requirements of designs. In all, the
            efficiency and practicality of the weapon system operation was
            confirmed to be excellent,” it said. It appeared that Kim wasn’t in
            attendance to observe the tests. KCNA said Kim’s top military
            official, Pak Jong Chon, observed the test-firings and called for
            the country’s defense scientists to go “all out to increase” the
            North’s military capabilities. Kim’s powerful sister last month
            hinted that North Korea was ready to resume weapons testing while
            issuing a statement berating the United States and South Korea for
            continuing their joint military exercises, which she said was the
            “most vivid expression of U.S. hostile policy.” She then said the
            North would boost its pre-emptive strike capabilities while another
            senior official threatened unspecified countermeasures that would
            leave the allies facing a “security crisis.” The allies say the
            drills are defensive in nature, but they have canceled or downsized
            them in recent years to create space for diplomacy or in response to
            COVID-19. Talks between the United States and North Korea have
            stalled since the collapse of a summit between Trump and Kim in
            2019, when the Americans rejected the North’s demand for major
            sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear
            capabilities. Kim’s government has so far rejected the Biden
            administration’s overtures for dialogue, demanding that Washington
            abandon its “hostile” policies first. The latest tests came after
            Kim threw an unusual parade in capital Pyongyang last week that was
            a marked departure from past militaristic displays, showcasing
            anti-virus workers in hazmat suits and civil defense organizations
            involved in industrial work and rebuilding communities destroyed by
            floods instead of missiles and other provocative weaponry. Experts
            said that the parade was focused on domestic unity as Kim now faces
            perhaps his toughest test with North Korea wrestling with U.S.-led
            economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons, pandemic border
            closures that are causing further strain to its broken economy, and
            food shortages worsened by floods in recent summers.
